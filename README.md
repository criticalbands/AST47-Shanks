 Code for the new compact 3.0 version of the 3.0 of the Galvanic Control SET/SIM Processor.  uses two L9110 drivers to move four DC motors forward with control via a potentiometer. Created by compiling my old code with an example I found that uses the L9110â€™s which I used as my basis. It may not be as elegant but it works enough for what I want it to do. Original code is here https://www.electroschematics.com/electric-lazy-susan/ for reference. 
 
 Connect it to 5v if motors are 2-5v or 12v for 12v motors or include a step down

An On-Off-On Switch is set to select either 5V or an input source to output into a potentiometer which then goes into an Analog in and an intdicator LED Resitor/LED.

hope its fun!
