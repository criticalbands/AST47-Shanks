Code for the new compact version of my motor driver which uses two L9110S drivers to move four DC motors forward with control via a potentiometer. Created by compiling my old code with an example I found that uses the L9110â€™s so It may not be as elegant but it works enough for what I want it to do. Original code is here https://www.electroschematics.com/electric-lazy-susan/ if that is useful.
